# PROJECT 2 - TELL A STORY WITH DATA



## PROJECT DESCRIPTION


* For the second project, your task will be to "tell a story" through data visualiztions

* Unlike the first project, where you focused on using the "Analytics Paradigm" to explore relationships in "report form", this project should be more focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 

* Just as with the first project, you will be asked to conduct a 10 minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization.

* You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly. The universe is wide and expansive. Don't limit yourself to what you know. 

* You will have roughly two weeks to complete this project. You will present your final work on **Thursday (September 20, 2018)**. You will have ample time in class to work with your group (but expect to put in some long nights in the days ahead).




## REQUIREMENTS


* Your project must include a **Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)**

* Your project should fall into one of the below **four tracks**: 
    
	* A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e. non-standard graph or chart)
    
	* A combination of Web Scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    
	* A dashboard page with multiple charts all updating from the same data
    
	* A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

* Your project should include **at least one JS library** that we did not cover.

* Your project must be powered by a **dataset with at least 100 records**.

* Your project must include some level of **user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.**).

* Your final visualization should ideally **include at least three views**.
